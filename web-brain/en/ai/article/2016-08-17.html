<p>There are so many sources about both human and artificial intelligence available these days but all of them have one weakness in common: their authors have no idea what human intelligence really is, they do not know how human brain is working and therefore their ability to explain anything about human or artificial intelligence is naturally very limited.

<p>I am the author of brain algorithms underlying the phenomenon of human intelligence and hence my invented brain algorithms make artificial intelligence a dream come true.

<p>Because I understand what is going on in human brain, because I know how our brains are functioning I can give you professional expertise about both human and artificial intelligence and all other things it concerns.

<p>This is a good reason to come here to look for serious answers to your questions about human or artificial intelligence. And in the case you donâ€™t find your answer here, just ask me for it, I will do my best to satisfy you.
