<p>I have to admit everyday programming makes you so tired and depressed. You feel like you have to do the whole important work in the world alone, like you are the only one, like there are only idiots around. And every now and then you need to turn off and concentrate on the other small things coming off the backdoor.

<p>Fortunately these days there are so many excellent institutes, universities, companies, start-ups, professors and experts of any kind helping you in giving excellent advice on how artificial intelligence is changing our lives, how the road map to AI will lead us to understanding of human level intelligence, how AI schools will acquire new skills for artificial intelligence based on framework of self-improving implementations, and the goals of highly dynamic problems.

<p>Well, not all has been solved yet in this wonderful world but I am very confident that you colleagues will not hesitate to close up any holes soon that may still be opened out there.

<p>So folks, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgIaoho3eHw&t=0m13s" class =link><b>HERE</b></a> is what we inventors and smart people think of companies and start-ups researching AI especially those receiving funding from above and beyond.

<p>And <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kw50ViHDZds" class=link><b>HERE</b></a> is what we think of well paid professors and scientists doing this great job researching AI for over 60 years on universities and academic institutions worldwide.

<p>That's why you should be proud of yourself with what have you already achieved in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jD369_rcgw&t=0m14s" class= link><b>PAST</b></a> and what will you achieve next in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lFZrUZIMGY&start=20" class= link><b>FUTURE</b></a>.

<p>Dear colleagues in all corners of the world, AI is great but itâ€™s all about <b>brain</b> and its unique <b>powers</b> to change this universe once for ever.

<p>I wish you all good luck in your important work on general artificial intelligence and thank you very much for your wonderful job.

<p>God bless you and come here again!

<p>Dr. Moravcik (inventor of brain algorithms simulating general functions of our brain)
