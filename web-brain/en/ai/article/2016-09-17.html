<p>This is my comment on an interview with Dr. Eric Horvitz from Microsoft available on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_snWCygK6U" class=link><b>YouTube</b></a>.

<p>Eric, I am sure that even the ancient Greeks could invent Artificial General Intelligence as I did!

<p>I am sure that you don't need big data and today's supercomputers to decipher how human brain works. I am pretty sure it was possible to do it already in the sixties, and I am also sure that even the ancient Greeks would do it if you had explained them what computers are about.

<p>So why don't we have intelligent machines even today when hardware is ready?

<p>That's an incorrect expression. We have this technology already NOW because I have invented brain algorithms that simulate human brain, I know how to build fully conscious intelligent machines that behave like humans. But the problem is no one wants to build such smart machines. Politicians are afraid, big tech companies are afraid, everyone is just talking tons of nonsense about AI instead of building real conscious machines that mean our future. Neither Cortana nor Siri will solve problems in our world. Only conscious intelligent machines that behave like humans (and can do some things much better than we do) and that I have already invented can make our world <b>BETTER</b>!

<p>It's in the best interests of America to manufacture first humanoid robots that behave like humans. If you underestimate this emerging new strategic industry other nations will take over. Production of humanoid robots is the key to 21st century. Who can master this technology will win this century! I am the inventor of Artificial General Intelligence (strong AI) and you can trust me when I am saying that it is even the key to the whole future of this planet.
