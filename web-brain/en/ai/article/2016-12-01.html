<p>Got your <a href="http://www.commerce.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2016/11/commerce-announces-first-artificial-intelligence-hearing" class=link><b>message</b></a> although not quite sure if got it right. One thing concerns me though.

<p>There is no other country in the world that produces daily so many articles about AI like United States and yet I feel we need to concentrate on other important things too. AI is just word, it is just software, AI needs a robot and robot has a body. Why don’t we concentrate from now on on the daily advances in robotics? If there were so many advances in the construction of humanoid robots that we urgently need as they are in the AI it would be great. America would be great again!

<p>Look, I am only human. I have only two hands and one brain. I cannot do everything that’s needed alone.

<p>For example we need artificial skin for the humanoid robots urgently. Without it not only you won’t be able to put your pants on but you cannot sense if there is a hot or freezing object in the vicinity, you cannot do many movement things that humans can.

<p>We need artificial skin as soon as possible!
