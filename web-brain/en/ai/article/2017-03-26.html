<p>So Baidu, the Chinese internet company removed Andrew Ng from his position. This is a notable event worth mentioning.

<p>Andrew Ng is good guy and good expert. I was following his speeches in internet for months. Recently he said AI is like electricity. He certainly was not that good like electricity wizard Thomas Edison who invented the light bulb and he was not that good like me (the God) who invented like human brain is working but he was an excellent teacher China can be proud of. I believe he will be of great value to Chinese science and education. I wish China had more such smart teachers like Andrew.
