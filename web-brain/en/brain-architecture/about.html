Dr. Zdenek Moravcik announced already in year 2016 his software technology simulating human brain in its full complexity.
Since 2016 this technology is awaiting its fullfilment in form of (super-)intelligent robots with brain.

<p>Unfortunately politicians worldwide are against my technology.
Worldwide conspiracy against building my robots with brain can be seen in the media as a phenomenon they call "artificial intelligence hype".
But it is no hype. The more politicians and media talk and write about artificial intelligence the less is the chance we will ever get the real one.
Historically it is usually called state driven propaganda.

<p>Articles and videos on this page are dealing with algorithms describing human brain function.
