<p>The best and brightest thing on this planet is without any doubts the human brain. Its equivalent is the <b>brain’s simulation <i>in silico</i></b>. This is what is usually called general artificial intelligence. So how to keep the silicone brain I have invented in United States?

<p>First of all have a look on what a silicone brain is good for. Maybe you think it will do wonders just out of the box but I have to disappoint you. It is the same situation as when I put a human brain on your hand. What will you do with it? What is a brain alone good for? The answer is it is alone good almost for nothing. Brain needs a body! So we need a robotic body in United States. Do we have it?

<p>Let’s take a closer look on this problem. What do we all need to construct robotic body suitable for my silicone brain?

<p>First, we need a humanoid body that mimics the mechanical functions of human body, i.e. hands, legs, muscles, tendons, eyes, ears… Good news is we have this all already and when not it is only because the robotic engineers are too lazy to construct the working parts. Trust me, no fundamental inventions are needed.

<p>Then we need the brain in its physical form. My software brain simulation needs a computer that will become robot’s brain. No, your IBM PC or laptop won’t do. We need to construct a new hardware architecture that can satisfy the needs of robotic body (so many input and output data, so much real time processing etc.) And again, we have distinguished companies that can do this all. They can construct new computer hardware, add more memory, new processors… Believe me, no quantum computers are needed to simulate human brain.

<p>Then we need artificial skin! Without a skin a robot is nothing more than a muscular corpse shown in an anatomical museum. Without a skin you cannot learn how to walk, you cannot grasp things, you cannot fulfill mechanical tasks… Skin is simply a must for the robot. And again we already have many prototypes of robotic skin available. What we need is only to push skin researchers to work hard as I do!

<p>I think that’s about all what we need to construct conscious robotic beings.

<p>If we work hard we have our robotic companions that will take the work away from us not in several decades but in just several years.

<p>But it does NOT depend wholly on me. It is a task for US leaders to decide if America wants to have conscious robotic technology in several years or in several decades!

<p>Make America great, make America first, build my conscious intelligent robots and let them roll off conveyor belts like the T’s of Ford Motor Company! That’s how you will bring and keep the best and brightest in the United States.
