<p>Text of the video:

<p>In this video I will make a definition of a brain. It will be useful for following videos that will be released soon.

<p>Brain is a computing system. That means it is what we know under the name computer. Please understand that the name computer implies computing and this is calculating mathematical operations. But computers main task is to run algorithms not to do some math. 
So the name computer was not selected very carefully in the past. Better name would be required for this machine.

<p>If brain is a computer then what differentiates it from other computers like computers we have on a table? The answer is simple. Computer is a brain when it runs certain specific set of algorithms that we call brain algorithms. It is always brain algorithms that make a computer to a brain.

<p>Definition of a brain is as follows: it is a computer running specific set of algorithms called brain algorithms. 
And you will see how this definition will be used in future videos.

<p><b>Question: if I put brain algorithms inside old 8bit computer will it become brain?</b>

<p>Yes, of course. This definition is general and independent of any specific hardware. Only condition is you must have a hardware that is capable of running algorithms. That is mandatory. If the computer is slow or not and what its hardware structure looks like is not important.
